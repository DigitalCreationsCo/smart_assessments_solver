In order to protect the abuse of this script, we didn't add the critical parts (such as Selenium Selectors) in the scripts. The script still has the same effect as it had before (a perfect thing to learn from)
## How to setup on your PC

First of all, clone this repo to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sdhmh/smart-assessments-solver
```

Linux-based Distributions:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.psl
```

Then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to run main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

Remember to always run `main.py`. Make necessary change in it if you want to solve different problems.


## Important! Populate `.env` file

```bash
cp sample.env .env
```

Now, open `.env` with any text editor and populate your
`.env` file with either `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`
(your username and password on the portal) or `COOKIES_FILE`
(Copy Cookies using Cookie-Editor Extension as json
and paste it in a file. Give the path to that file either relative or absolute)
